<!-- User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->

      <p>Git is an open source distributed version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and others from the
        Linux development community. Git can work with many types of projects, but it’s most commonly used for software
        source code.</p>
      <p>Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file or group of files over time. When you have a
        history of these changes, it lets you find specific versions later, compare changes between versions, recover
        files you may have deleted, or revert files to previous versions.</p>
      <p>A distributed version control system means that different users maintain their own repositories of a project,
        instead of working from one central repository. Users automatically have full file tracking abilities and the
        project’s complete version history without needing access to a central server or network.</p>
      <p>When Git is initialized in a project directory, it begins tracking file changes and stores them as “change
        sets” or “patches.” Users working together on a project submit their change sets which are then included (or
        rejected) in the project.</p>

        <h1>Difference between Git and GitHub</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Git and Github are two different things. Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a service for
        hosting Git repos and help people collaborate on writing software. However, they are often confounded because of
        their similar name, because of the fact that GitHub builds on top of Git, and because many websites and articles
        don’t make the difference between them clear enough.</p>
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>Git is the distributed version control system. Git is responsible for keeping track of changes to content –
        usually source code files.</p>
      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a company that provides Git repository hosting. That means that they provide a turnkey solution to
        host Git repositories on their servers. That can be useful to keep a backup of your repository (Git only tracks
        the changes made to you files over time, the repo still needs to be backed up), and to have a centralized place
        to keep and share your code with others.</p>

      <p>More than just a Git repository hosting service, GitHub is a software forge. That means it also provides an
        issue tracker, tools for code review, and other tools for collaborating with other people and creating software.
      </p>

      <p>GitHub isn’t the only one to provide this kind of service. One of its major competitors is GitLab.</p>

        <h1>Three Sections of a Git Project</h1>
      </header>
      <p>A git project will have the following three main sections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Git directory</li>
        <li>Working directory (or working tree)</li>
        <li>Staging area</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Git directory (located in <code>YOUR-PROJECT-PATH/.git/</code>) is where Git stores everything it needs to accurately track the project. This includes metadata and an object database which includes compressed versions of the project files.</p>

        <p>The working directory is where a user makes local changes to a project. The working directory pulls the project’s files from the Git directory’s object database and places them on the user’s local machine.</p>
        
        <p>The staging area is a file (also called the “index”, “stage”, or “cache”) that stores information about what will go into your next commit. A commit is when you tell Git to save these staged changes. Git takes a snapshot of the files as they are and permanently stores that snapshot in the Git directory.</p>
        
        <p>With three sections, there are three main states that a file can be in at any given time: committed, modified, or staged. You modify a file any time you make changes to it in your working directory. Next, it’s staged when you move it to the staging area. Finally, it’s committed after a commit.</p>
